I have been practicing Physical Therapy since 1982.  I was raised in a physical therapy family and continue to share information with my Dad, a physical therapist, who practiced up until the age of 88.  I am results oriented, just like Dad.


While growing up in a physical therapy environment, I realized early on that helping people, whether with a sporting injury or after surgery was very rewarding.  In my clinic, I have learned the value of one-to-one patient interaction and provide each patient with a personalized touch and a hands on approach in private treatment rooms.  My goal is to create a positive rehabilitative experience for each patient because I realize that your time is important and you have a choice where to receive your physical therapy.
